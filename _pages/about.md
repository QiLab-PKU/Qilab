The Qi Lab investigates the molecular mechanisms driving neurodegenerative diseases using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), and in situ structural biology.

We focus on **pathogenic tau filaments**, **MAPT mutations**, and **amyloid propagation mechanisms**, aiming to understand how structural polymorphism encodes disease specificity and how genetic mutations reshape filament architecture.

### Our Vision

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia are characterized by abnormal protein aggregation. We aim to **bridge molecular structure and disease phenotype**, providing mechanistic insights that may inform future therapeutic strategies.

### Approach

- High-resolution cryo-EM structure determination  
- Cryo-FIB lamella preparation for in situ studies  
- Cryo-ET of patient-derived tissue samples  
- Biochemical and cellular reconstitution  
- Structure-guided mechanistic analysis
